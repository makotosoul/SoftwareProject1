In a quaint village, a rumor of a hidden treasure beneath the old oak sparked a frenzy. Villagers dug all day and night, hoping to find riches. Among them was Eli, a young boy with a wild imagination. Unlike the others, he sought the tree's wisdom, not wealth. One moonlit night, as he lay under its branches, the tree whispered a secret. It wasn't gold or jewels that were buried, but a seed from a time when magic thrived. Eli planted it, and overnight, a magnificent tree sprouted, its leaves shimmering with enchantment. The true treasure was the revival of wonder in the village.
